AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT

To implement data link layer framing techniques such as
i.Character count ii.Character stuffing iii.Bit stuffing

Step by step process

For Character Count
1.Enter number of frames
2.print the data as frames
3.find the string length of each frame
4.print the databoth at sender and receiver side

For Bit stuffing
1.Take the input as number of frames
2.enterdatabits
3.apply the bitstuffinglogic at the sender side
4.Destuff the bits at the receiver side and print the output

For Character stuffing
1.Take the input characters size based on the input size enter character data
2.print the original data
3.Apply the character stuffing logic at the sender side and print data
4.at the receiver side default the stuffed and print output
