Aim of the Experiment
To implement Dijsktra’s algorithm to compute the shortest path through a network

Steps or procedure of Experiment
step 1: Create cost matrix C[ ][ ] from adjacency matrix adj[ ][ ]. C[i][j] is the cost of going from vertex i to vertex j. If there is no edge between vertices i and j then C[i][j] is infinity.

step 2: Array visited[ ] is initialized to zero.

for(i=0;i<n;i++) visited[i]=0;

step 3: If the vertex 0 is the source vertex then visited[0] is marked as 1. step 4: Create the distance matrix, by storing the cost of vertices from vertex no. 0 to n-1 from the source vertex 0. for (i=1; i<n;i++) distance[i]=cost[0][i]; Initially, distance of source vertex is taken as 0. i.e. distance[0]=0;

step 5: for(i=1;i<n;i++) – Choose a vertex w, such that distance[w] is minimum and visited[w] is 0. Mark visited[w] as 1. – Recalculate the shortest distance of remaining vertices from the source.

– Only, the vertices not marked as 1 in array visited[ ] should be considered for recalculation of distance. i.e. for each vertex v

if(visited[v]==0) distance[v]=min(distance[v], distance[w]+cost[w][v])
